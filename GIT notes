git init - initializes git in current folder (creates a new local repos)

git add - adds file to staging area (prepares it for commit)

git status - shows the current status - which files are staged, unstaged or untracked

git commit -m "message" - saves teh staged changes in your local repos with a message

git remote add origin <githublink>

git push -u origin master/main - pushes file from local to remote repo (Github)

    NOTES
    - after the first push with -u, you can just use : git push (git remembers the remote and branch automatically)
    - you only run git remote add once per project, not every time you push

git checkout - rolls back to the previous version

git diff <filename>

git reset --soft HEAD~1 - Your code stays the same. Use this if you just want to fix the commit message or re-stage files.


git reset --hard HEAD~1 - This deletes your unpushed commit and all changes from it. Use this only if you’re sure you don’t need the recent edits.
